                    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which can be a confusing term for many beginners. The
                        best way to explain HTML is to examine the meaning of each word.HTML is the standard language
                        that is used for creating webpages and web applications.
                        <br/><br/>
                        HyperText refers to text that contains links to other texts. Every time you click on a
                        highlighted or underlined link that takes you to another page, you are using hypertext. As more
                        and more pages use hypertext to link to each other, a “web” of pages starts to form. This is
                        where we get the term World Wide Web.
                        <br/><br/>

                        Markup refers to the special symbols or codes that are inserted into a document to tell the web
                        browser how to display the document data. For example, markup code may tell the browser to
                        display a phrase in bold or italic text, or may tell the browser which parts of the document are
                        headings and which are paragraphs. HTML is just one of a number of languages that uses markup
                        code.
                        <br/><br/>

                        Language refers to the idea that the code is standardized. Just like regular spoken languages,
                        there are certain rules that everyone must follow when writing HTML. This is so that all
                        browsers can understand and interpret the code. There are many different programming languages,
                        and you may have heard of some of the popular ones such as Java, Python and Ruby. Each language
                        has its own unique set of rules, and many languages can be used in combination with HTML to
                        create amazing webpages and applications.
                        <br/><br/>

                        If we put these three definitions together, we could say that HTML is “a programming language
                        that uses unique code which allows you to display linked documents in a browser”. </p>
